# Pipelines Hugo

This is a Docker image that contains Hugo, the static website generator and the aws-cli Python scripts. I use this container to deploy my Hugo blog to AWS S3 using Atlassian Bitbucket Pipelines.

Check [this blog post](https://www.karelbemelmans.com/2016/10/deploying-a-hugo-website-to-amazon-s3-using-bitbucket-pipelines/) for more information about how to use this Docker image for your Pipelines setup.

Hugo version: 0.68.0
